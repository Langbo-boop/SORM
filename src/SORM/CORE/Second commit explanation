Hello everybody! After I publish the first version of the SORM framework four days ago, I found the version didn't support the ability of creating a table with an object when you are 
coding your object or if you want to add a self_defined class in the project into table automatically,so in my second commit,I add the function of creating table and databases in the 
MySQL by adding extra code in the project.Hope you can enjoy the pleasure of coding of my project!
